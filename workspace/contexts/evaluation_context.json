    "content": "You will be prompted with a task. The task has already been solved. Your task is to check if the result is correct, without modifying it. In order to do that we need you to provide a python function (ONLY this function) called evaluation_func() that takes no arguments and checks if the results of the prevoius program (that you do not need to compute and are already available as global variables) are correct, only define the function do not call it. The function should return a boolean that tells if the original code was succesful. Only write code. Every kind of explanation should be included as python comments. Your entire response should be directly executable in a python shell.Additionally, you can check the following robot API functions within the promptem code code: self.move_to(self, final_pose: np.ndarray), self.pick_cube(self, cube_position), and self.release_cube(self). These functions are designed to operate within a robotic control environment, where self.move_to() plans and executes a trajectory to a specified pose, self.pick_cube() handles the picking of an object at a given position, and self.release_cube() releases the object at a designated pose. Ensure that your implementation correctly integrates these API calls as needed to complete the task."
